For submissions, please see our submissions page.

We love to hear from other writers, satisfied readers, or anyone else. The best way to get in touch is to use the form below or drop a line; our address is info at paragraphline.com

We love paper zines and newsletters and free books and postcards, but we don’t love paper spam from people offering to refinance our mortgage. If you’ve got some dead tree you’d like to send our way, drop us an email and we’ll give you the coordinates.

Please contact us if:

You also publish a literary journal/zine and would like to trade or otherwise network.
You work for a web or print publication that reviews books or zines and would like a copy and more information.
You liked an issue or story and would like to tell us. (I can also forward email to authors, in most cases.)
To contact us, email “info” at paragraphline dot com.
